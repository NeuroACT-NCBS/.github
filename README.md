## 🚀 About Us

The **NeuroACT Lab** aims to understand how internal cognitive computations dynamically engage with ongoing actions during complex behaviors, and how these interactions change with age.  
We employ an interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from neuroscience, behavior, biomechanics, and computational methods.

Our research focuses on:
- Neural mechanisms underlying spatial navigation and decision-making
- Coordination between action and memory processes
- Cognitive-motor changes during aging
